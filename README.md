**Infin** is an open-source Discord bot written in Python that is designed around modularity and flexibility.  
Infin is designed to be self-hosted; there isn't really one global Infin instance.  
You can invite your instance of Infin to your server, and configure it to your needs.  
Installation details are available in the wiki.
